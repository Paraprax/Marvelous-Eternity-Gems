    <h1>Uncountable Gems!</h1>

    <h3>Click on the Uncountable Gems to generate power-points!</h3>

    <h3>The number of points they generate changes every round, and is a mystery until each is clicked!</h3>

    <h3>Click each gem until your score and the Universal Number are perfectly balanced - as all things should be! But be careful not to go too far....</h3>
